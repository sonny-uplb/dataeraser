# Data Eraser

This was my Special Problem Project for my Master of Information Technology Degree titled "Implementation of Data Erasure Algorithms using BIOS Calls".

The following data erasure algorithms are used:
- DOD 5220.22-M
- Schneier's Algorithm
- British HMG Standard
- Australian ASCI 33
- German VSITR Standard
- Peter Gutmann's Algorithm

This was run on a special hardware which was proprietary.
